## Our process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)


### What we learned
 
 Here are some of the key learnings that stood out:

 - Collaboration and Communication: Working together as a team of three developers has taught us the importance of effective communication and collaboration. We've learned to leverage each other's strengths and support one another in areas where we needed to grow.

 - Error Handling and Debugging: We've become adept at identifying and resolving errors, which is a crucial skill in any developer's toolkit.

 - Version Control with Git: Our use of Git for version control has become second nature. It's a fundamental skill that we'll carry forward in all our future collaborations.
